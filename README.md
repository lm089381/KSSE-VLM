# KSSE-VLM: Knowledge-guided Structure-Semantic Enhancement Medical Visual-Language Model for Radiology Report Generation
Code for paper: Knowledge-aware Context Enhancement Network with Dual-path Attention for Radiology Report Generation

**Datasets**

We use two datasets (IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR) in our paper.

For IU X-Ray, you can download the dataset from [here](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/) and then put the files in iu_xray.

For MIMIC-CXR, you can download the dataset from [here](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.1.0/) and then put the files in mimic.

**Usage**

Run the code:

`python train.py`

**Test**

Please use the [nlg-eval](https://github.com/Maluuba/nlg-eval/) and the [chexpert](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-cxr/tree/master/txt/chexpert/)
